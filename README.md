# Apple Music Playlist Style Artwork
## Goal: Make a website that easily creates artwork in the style of Apple Music Playlist covers!

### Current Status: Abandoned


What I Tried:
* Use a colorpicker so user could manually select cradient
* Use a canvas to create gradients 
  * Slow if the size is too big
  * New colors take too long to update
  * Responsive to browser size
* Add text to canvas via Apple San Francisco Font
  * Tried to manually find ratios for where text boxes should go 
  * Font and positions was scaled for canvas size
    * Didn't line up with what was expected
* Convert canvas to image and download
